-This is my T3 Tech Exercise for Software Engineering class. It is a very simple Recipe book applicaiton to create and save recipies. 
-It uses python flask for the web framework, sqlite for the database, apache2 to serve http requests, I use git to track all of my changes/commits, and it is hosted on my Amazon EC2 server instance
